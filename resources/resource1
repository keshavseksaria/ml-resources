1. Build foundations, and then specialize in areas of interest.

You can’t go deeply into every machine learning topic. There’s too much to learn, and the field is advancing rapidly. Master foundational concepts and then focus on projects in a specific domain of interest — whether it’s natural language understanding, computer vision, deep reinforcement learning, robotics, or whatever else.

2. Design your curriculum around topics that personally excite you.

Motivation is far more important than micro-optimizing a learning strategy for some long-term academic or career goal. If you’re having fun, you’ll make fast progress. If you’re trying to force yourself forward, you’ll slow down.

We’ve included resources that we explored personally or came highly recommended. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are endless options, and too much choice is counterproductive. But if we’re missing a great resource that belongs here, please reach out!
