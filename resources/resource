When I was writing books on networking and programming topics in the early 2000s, the web was a good, but an incomplete resource. Blogging had started to take off, but YouTube wasn’t around yet, nor was Quora, Twitter, or podcasts. Over ten years later as I’ve been diving into AI and machine learning, it is a completely different ballgame. There are so many resources — it’s difficult to know where to start (and stop)!
To save you some of the effort I went through in researching all the different nooks and crannies of the web to find the best content; I’ve organized them into a big collection here. I’m only include links to free content. There is enough free content to keep you busy for a while. It’s amazing just how much information is available on machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence on the web. This article should give you a sense of the scope.
I’ve created sections below that contain: well-known researchers, AI organizations, video courses, bloggers, Medium writers, books, YouTube channels, Quora topics, subreddits, Github repos, podcasts, newsletters, conferences, research links, tutorials, and cheat sheets. It’s a lot, but given the popularity of my Tutorials and Cheat Sheets articles, there seems to be a need for this kind of curated list.
Note: I wrote this in early July 2017. In some sections, I’ve included subscriber/follower/view counts, which will go out-of-date as soon as the article is published, but it should still be useful to give you a sense of interest level.
Let me know if there anything good I’m missing! I’m always looking to add to the list.
Researchers
Many of the most well-known AI researchers have a strong presence on the web. Below I’ve listed around twenty and included links to their website, Wikipedia page, Twitter profile, Google Scholar profile, and Quora profile. Quite a few have done an Ask-Me-Anything on Reddit or a Quora Session so I’ve included that is well when applicable.
I could include dozens more in a list like this. See Quora for more names.
